  <h1>Heading 1</h1>

  <p>This is some standard text with <strong>Bold/Strong</strong> and <em>Emphasised</em> text</p>
  <p>Multiple paragraphs have spacing</p>
  <p>Making it easier to read. Additionally the spacing between lines is increased and the font sizes are based of em units to allow for a single hard coded font size that all other elements are built off of. Quotes are highlighted from other text: <q>I've been writing sub-par code for 48 hours and I want to kill myself. How do you do it every day Dinesh?</q></p>
